  <h2>Carbonara</h3>
  <p>Carbonara (Italian: [karboˈnaːra]) is a pasta dish[1][2] made with eggs, hard cheese, fatty cured pork, and black pepper. The dish took its modern form and name in the middle of the 20th century.[3]

    The cheese is usually pecorino romano. Some variations use Parmesan, Grana Padano, or a combination of cheeses.[1][4][5] Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but rigatoni or bucatini are also used. While guanciale, a cured pork jowl, is traditional, some variations use pancetta,[1][2] and lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy.</h2>
    <li>4 ounces guanciale, cut into 1/4-inch cubes</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
    <li>6 ounces spaghetti</li>
    <li>1 cup reserved pasta water</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook guanciale with olive oil and 1 teaspoon ground black pepper in a Dutch oven over medium-low heat until almost crisp, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low.</li>
    <li>Whisk eggs, 3 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, 3 tablespoons Pecorino Romano cheese, and 1 teaspoon ground black pepper in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water.</li>
    <li>Pour reserved pasta water and drained spaghetti into the bacon-pepper mixture; stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Slowly pour egg mixture into the pasta mixture; cook, stirring constantly until the egg mixture forms a thick sauce, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Stir remaining 3 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and 3 tablespoons Pecorino Romano cheese into the pasta mixture and serve.</li>
